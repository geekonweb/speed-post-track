Unofficial speed post tracking api

Speed Post is a service offered by India Post for quick and reliable delivery of letters and parcels. It provides a convenient way to send important documents or items both domestically and internationally.

An important advantage of Speed Post is its tracking facility. You can easily monitor the progress of your shipment throughout its journey using several methods:

Online Tracking: Visit the India Post website or use a third-party tracking app. Enter your <a href="https://www.speedposttrack.in/">Speed Post tracking </a> number, typically a 13-digit code, to see the current location and status of your shipment.
SMS Tracking: Send an SMS with "POST TRACK <Your Tracking Number>" to 51969 or 166. You'll receive a reply with the latest status update.
Speed Post tracking keeps you informed and allows you to plan accordingly.

While directly automating captcha solving using Python for Speed Post tracking on the India Post website is against their terms of service and may not be reliable due to evolving captcha mechanisms, here are alternative approaches that align with ethical guidelines and provide a robust solution:

Manual Captcha Solving:
Integrate a user interface (UI) element like a web browser window or image display within your Python program.
Prompt the user to solve the captcha visually and enter the solution into a designated field within the UI.
Once the user provides the captcha code, your program can proceed with submitting the tracking information.
